            "The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian
            Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964,
            eight
            other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John
            Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest
            novel
            is Forever and a Day by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2018. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series
            on a
            young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series
            character,
            Moneypenny.

            The character—also known by the code number 007 (pronounced "double-O-seven")—has also been adapted for
            television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running film
            series
            of all time and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film series
            to
            date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021, there have been
            twenty-four
            films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (2015), stars Daniel Craig in his
            fourth
            portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two
            independent
            productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and Never Say Never Again (a
            1983
            remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's Thunderball, both starring Connery). In 2015 the series was
            estimated to be worth $19.9 billion,[1] making James Bond one of the highest-grossing media franchises of
            all
            time."
